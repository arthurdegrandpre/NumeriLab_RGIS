## Context

Most would agree that data science should always start and end with data visualization. It allows the scientist to understand the data, its structure and distribution, but also to connect with the public, by creating easily understandable content to facilitate communication. 

In the previous workshops, we have learned how to: 
- Efficiently visualize data and results
- Manipulate Data to facilitate its analysis
- Optimize replicability and sharing of our codes

... and all of this makes it hard to leave the R environment! Still, most of us still are leaving the comfort of R whenever we are faced with spatial data, splitting our workflow and creating different codes, different processes and ultimately resulting in a loss of time and efficiency.


## R as a GIS and Mapping Software

To address this problem, multiple libraries have been made available in R in order to deal with spatial data, its visualisation, its manipulation and its analysis.
the most notable are probably:

ggmap : This package is an extension for ggplot2 allowing the plotting of spatial data into maps
rgdal : An interface to access gdal, a spatial data processing library
rgeos : An interface to access geos, a spatial vector data processing library
maptools : Provides mapping functions
tmap : A mapping package
leafy : Used to create interactive maps. this is one of the most used package for online maps
sp
raster
spdep


## Goals

reading a raster from file
loading basemap from internet
loading satellite data from internet
reading shapefile

saving layers
mapping (multiple views, legends, scales, titles, etc.)
exporting maps

manipulate shapefile
rasterize
raster calculator
vectorize
buffer
clip
zonal statistics
landscape metrics



## Exercice:

Step 1. Prepare R environment
```{r preparation}
rm(list=ls())
gc()

library(sp)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)

```

Step 2. Loading and plotting rasters, vectors and basemaps


```{r loading and plotting rasters, vectors and basemaps}

tr_r = raster("./Data/EO_Browser_S2_20180913/True color.tiff")
plot(tr_r)
tr_r


tr_r = brick("./Data/EO_Browser_S2_20180913/True color.tiff")
tr_r
plot(tr_r)
plotRGB(tr_r, main="Trois-Rivières on 2018-09-13, Sentinel-2")

```



load high resolution image of trois-rivières and campus polygon
clip for raster of campus only
classify the campus land cover
vectorize / rasterize

load proba-v 100m region data,
use status map to mask out bad data
calculate NDVI
dissolve campus forest polygons to extract zonal statistics data from proba-v 100 TOC

insert sampling stations from around trois-rivières (points)
buffer around them at r=100m for zonal statistics


Extra:






load high resolution data from around all those stations and classify them
obtain landscape metrics and zonal stats of sampling stations in trois-rivières
